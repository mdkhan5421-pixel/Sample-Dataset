This project involves visualizing the distribution of categorical and continuous variables from the adult.csv dataset, which contains demographic information about individuals, such as age, sex, education, occupation, and income.

The two main variables explored are:

Sex (Gender) – A categorical variable

Age – A continuous variable

The visualizations created help in understanding the composition of the population represented in the dataset.

📊 1. Gender Distribution (Bar Chart):
A bar chart (count plot) is used to visualize the distribution of the 'sex' variable. It shows the number of male and female individuals in the dataset.

Purpose: To understand the gender balance in the dataset.

Insight: From the chart, we can identify if there is any gender imbalance in the data, which might affect model training or analysis.

📈 2. Age Distribution (Histogram):
A histogram is used to visualize the distribution of the 'age' variable. It shows how ages are spread across different intervals (bins).

Purpose: To examine the frequency of individuals within specific age ranges.

Insight: This helps in identifying common age groups, the presence of outliers, and the general age pattern (e.g., skewed or normal distribution).

🔍 Conclusion:
These visualizations are a part of basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) and are essential for:

Understanding the structure of the dataset.

Detecting patterns or anomalies.

Informing decisions for data preprocessing and feature selection in machine learning.
